remember that for firefox you need a refresh everytime that you update your server/verifier certificate
this seems to be a bug, i.e. there is some cache that is responsible for the crosscheck of the certificate, and it is not clear
how to remove it

to refresh firefox:
1. click on help
2. click on troubleshooting
3. click refresh
